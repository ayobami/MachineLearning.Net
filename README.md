MachineLearning.Net
===================
In this project I would implement some Machine Learning algorithms I learnt after taking an online course 
in Machine Learning at Cousera.org (https://class.coursera.org/ml-006/lecture) using C#

Machine Learning Algorithm(s) Implemented
... Linear Regression Univariate


Implementation of the other algorithms would come later.


This project uses MathNet Library for Matrix operations
